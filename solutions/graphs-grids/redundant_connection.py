# Redundant Connection — Medium (#684)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/

r"""
In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with
one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1
to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array
edges of length n where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an edge
between nodes a_i and b_i in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes.
If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Example 1:
    [diagram: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-1-graph.jpg]
    Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
    Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
    [diagram: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg]
    Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
    Output: [1,4]

Constraints:
  - n == edges.length
  - 3 <= n <= 1000
  - edges[i].length == 2
  - 1 <= a_i < b_i <= edges.length
  - a_i != b_i
  - There are no repeated edges.
  - The given graph is connected."""
