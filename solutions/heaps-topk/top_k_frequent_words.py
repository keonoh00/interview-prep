r"""
Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent
strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words
with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

Example 1:
    Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
    Output: ["i","love"]
    Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Example 2:
    Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k
    = 4
    Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
    Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= words.length <= 500
  - 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
  - words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
  - k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?
