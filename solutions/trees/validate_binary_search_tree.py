r"""
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree
(BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the
    node's key.
  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than
    the node's key.
  - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
    [diagram: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg]
    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: true

Example 2:
    [diagram: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg]
    Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

Constraints:
  - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
  - -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
