r"""
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all
overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that
cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
    Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
    Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
    Output: [[1,5]]
    Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Example 3:
    Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
    Output: [[1,7]]
    Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
  - intervals[i].length == 2
  - 0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4
