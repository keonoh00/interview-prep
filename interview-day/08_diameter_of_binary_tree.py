# Diameter of Binary Tree — Easy (#543)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

r"""
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of its diameter: the number of
edges on the longest path between any two nodes. The path may or may not pass
through the root.

Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest paths are 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 and 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3,
    each with 3 edges.

Example 2:
    Input: root = [1,2]
    Output: 1

Constraints:
  - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
  - -100 <= Node.val <= 100"""
