# Find if Path Exists in Graph — Easy (#1971)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/

r"""
There is an undirected graph with n vertices, labelled 0 to n - 1. The edges are
given as a list, where edges[i] = [u_i, v_i] connects u_i and v_i both ways. No two
edges are the same, and no edge connects a vertex to itself.

Return true if there is a path from vertex source to vertex destination, and false
otherwise.

Example 1:
    Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
    Output: true
    Explanation: 0 -> 2 directly, or 0 -> 1 -> 2.

Example 2:
    Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], source = 0,
    destination = 5
    Output: false
    Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are connected to each other, and 3, 4 and 5 are
    connected to each other, but there is no edge between the two groups.

Constraints:
  - 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
  - 0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5
  - edges[i].length == 2
  - 0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1
  - u_i != v_i
  - 0 <= source, destination <= n - 1
  - There are no duplicate edges."""
