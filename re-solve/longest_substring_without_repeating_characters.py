# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters — Medium (#3)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

r"""
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate
characters.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and
    "cab" are also correct answers.

Example 2:
    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a
    substring.

Constraints:
  - 0 <= s.length <= 10^5
  - s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces."""

            list_container.append(current_char)
            set_container.add(current_char)
