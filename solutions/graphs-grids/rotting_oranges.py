# Rotting Oranges — Medium (#994)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/
# Day 7 · Mon 28 Sep

r"""
You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

  - 0 representing an empty cell,
  - 1 representing a fresh orange, or
  - 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange
becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh
orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
    [diagram: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png]
    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
    Output: 4

Example 2:
    Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never
    rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:
    Input: grid = [[0,2]]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is
    just 0.

Constraints:
  - m == grid.length
  - n == grid[i].length
  - 1 <= m, n <= 10
  - grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
